Hi. This is a netflix clone by Bhavya Gupta

We're using react as one of the technologies. This will be hosted by Google firebase and we'll use all the basic concepts of react to build the project and enable smooth functioning.

We start by creating row js to have in in app.js for root level components incorporation.

Now we'll work on routes and also focus on how these get refreshed .

I will be working on this model with Joel and Vaibhav who will be accompanying me to identify the code together's usage as we collaborate on this repository's code.

For a developre's POV, we're trying to understand if codeTogether can help us with identification of one's productivity by logging a day's work and also help with understanding the efforts to update a set of code or modify/add a logic.
