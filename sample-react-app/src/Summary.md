This is a netflix clone by Bhavya Gupta. I'm referrring to youtube videos and trying to learn react and implement those concepts to enhance my learning.

We will be using Google firebase later to host this because it is a unpaid resource. I will be pushing this code to my github repo and will keep it n repo sample-react so that I can refer to it later. 

The purpose of this code is to enhance learning and help myself later if I wish to refresh knowledge on the same..

I have worked on a IVR project prior to this and have identified that my work overall will be w.r.r react, .net as my core skill and azure as a devops skill in upcoming projects.
